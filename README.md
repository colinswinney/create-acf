# Create ACF
<br />

**Create ACF blocks and fields from the command line!**
<br/>

This plugin is heavily based off of the amazing [ACF Composer](https://github.com/Log1x/acf-composer) created for use with the [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) starter theme.  The purpose of this project is to provide a similar workflow in a stand alone plugin.
<br/>

To get started, navigate to `wp-content/plugins/create-acf` and run `composer install`.
